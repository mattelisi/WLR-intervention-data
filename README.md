# Dataset & analysis code

This repository contains the data and code supporting the article _"The effects of a reading-based intervention on emotion processing in children who have suffered early adversity and war related trauma"_
by Julia Michalek, Matteo Lisi, Deema Awad, Kristin Hadfield, Isabelle Mareschal, & Rana Dajani.

All the analyses are documented in on Rmarkdown file `WLR-analyses-report.Rmd`, which generates the pdf file `WLR-analyses-report.pdf`. Note that if you want to re-create the file locally you need to re-run MCMC sampling (the script `runMCMC.R`).
